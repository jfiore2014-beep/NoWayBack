# NoWayBack
NoEscape.exe is a cursed software simulation recovered from an abandoned drive. It uses GDI effects to melt your desktop and hijack processes like Ja666. This psychological horror experience targets the fear of losing control. Here, the exit button is a lie and the BSOD is just the start. You didn't open a game; you let something in.
